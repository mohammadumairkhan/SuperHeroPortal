		"name":"Peter Benjamin Parker",
		"height":"5'10",
		"weight":"167 lbs.",
		"powers":"Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes. Note: his power enhancements through his transformation by the Queen and after battling Morlun - including his organic web glands and stingers - have been undone after Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto.",
		"abilities":"Peter is an accomplished scientist, inventor and photographer.",
		"groupAffiliations":"Avengers, formerly the Secret Defenders, New Fantastic Four, the Outlaws"
